# Data-Mining-Project-Chicago-Crime
# Executive Summary
My objective was to locate and predict the top four most likely crimes in the city of Chicago to help make arrests more effective by associating data rules. 
1. Assault, battery, criminal damage, and theft are the top four crimes. By breaking down the crimes into their district areas and appointing dependent variables, I used them in modeling algorithms to drill down from there. The results were mixed and with some promise. 
2. Results showed some association between the data, so there are some conclusions to be drawn from them. My sample sizes were around ten to thirty thousand to pull good training and testing sets. 
3. By breaking up the cityâ€™s districts into north, central, and south, I was able to look more closely at the data relating to those crimes. 
4. My focus in this project was on location and on looking at arrests. This shows the number of crimes in those areas. 
5. With an average model success rate of around 67%, I found that the models I used do need some work to be more effective.
