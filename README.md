# Data Mining Prediction for Chicago Crime
# Executive Summary
My objective was to locate and predict the top four most likely crimes in the city of Chicago to help make arrests more effective by associating data rules utilizing R. 
1. Assault, battery, criminal damage, and theft are the top four crimes.
2. Results showed some association between the data, so there are some conclusions to be drawn from them.  
3. By breaking up the cityâ€™s districts into north, central, and south, I was able to look more closely at the data relating to those crimes. 
4. With an average model success rate of around 67%, I found that the models I used do need some work to be more effective.

# Business Problem
The purpose of this project is to shed light on the effects of crime and the likelihood of where crimes are committed in the city of Chicago, Illinois. My goal was to better police presence in the Chicago districts by allocating the right amount of resources to the needed areas.
